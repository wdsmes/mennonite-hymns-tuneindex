# Mennonite Hymns tune index
The oldest English-language hymnal produced by Mennonites was published in 1847.
It is known today as "Mennonite Hymns," although the title properly continues as
“A Collection of Songs, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs Suitable for Occasions of 
Public Worship and Private Devotion of the Church of Christ.”

[Here is an 1875 edition on hymnary.org](https://hymnary.org/hymnal/CPHS1875)

Like most hymnals from over 100 years ago, it did not contain notation.
(Due to [expense and difficulty](https://lilypond.org/doc/v2.24/Documentation/essay/engraving-details).)
It instead referenced “tune books” - the “[Philharmonia](https://archive.org/details/philharmoniacollwenger)”
and the “[Harmonia Sacra](https://www.harmoniasacra.org/)” in this case - that had the notes and a verse or two.
No one book had it all together. The book remains without notation today,
leaving song leaders free to choose whatever tune fits the song and the occasion.

This project is a "Tune Index," first lines of notation for commonly-used tunes.
It is produced for a "pocket edition" of the standard hymnal,
with a primary audience being song leaders in the Old Order Mennonite churches
which still use the book in worship services today.
